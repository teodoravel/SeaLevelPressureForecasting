Time Series Forecasting of Sea-Level Pressure in Skopje using Ensemble Learning
I explored ensemble learning techniques, specifically bagging and boosting, to predict average sea-level pressure in Skopje using historical weather data from January 2021 to August 2023. The dataset includes key meteorological parameters such as average/minimum/maximum temperature, precipitation, wind direction and speed, and seasonal information.
This project demonstrates how ensemble methods can effectively model meteorological time series and extract meaningful patterns from lagged features, improving prediction accuracy for weather-related variables.

Laboratory_exercise_3_Introduction_to_Data_Science_(02_12_2024).ipynb: Focuses on time series forecasting for predicting average sea-level pressure in Skopje using bagging (Random Forest) and boosting (XGBoost) methods, with a dataset containing meteorological features from January 1, 2021, to August 1, 2023. The task includes data preprocessing (e.g., lag feature creation, handling missing values), splitting the dataset, training ensemble models, and evaluating their performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RÂ².
